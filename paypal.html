                    <p>With the advancements in technology, humans have finally reached to a stage of an all-round global reach among people. The world is more connected now and Internet acted as a boon. There is a widespread increase in the field of online transactions and payments. With this proliferation of computing, mankind has entered into a new era of fast processing, speedy recovery and an all-time security.</p>

                    <p>Gone are the days, when people used to stand in long queues to credit or debit their bank accounts. The miserable culture of slow transactions have taken a back seat. The modern age of network connectivity and data protection have both raced up as well as delivered with security against theft and mischief respectively. All this and more, while sitting in front of a single screen and a few buttons. The online transaction of payments have almost changed the way the whole world spend their money. It has helped people exchange funds and assets at the same time, provided the comfort of their household setting. The upsurge of users adopting the online method of operation has enabled many merchants to set up their base in this field. People need a more open space of communicating, a safer environment and a simple interface to, well, not only understand but to enjoy their experience of sharing currencyâ€¦and PayPal is just that. 
</p>

<p>
	In the following report, I have copiously emphasized on the active functionality of PayPal-an online system or a web service that offers buyers/sellers to buy or receive money through a secure layer of protection. PayPal, basically acts as a middleman to your transaction, thereby enabling the transfer of funds without essentially, involving cash, cheques or credit and debit data. It offers a one-time account sign-in and reduces the effort of typing in your credit/debit card numbers every time you make a transaction. I have explained the operative functioning of a typical payment gateway with pertinent illustrations in the form of diagrams. I have also addressed the advantages and disadvantages of the PayPal system and have given a strong perspective on its impact on the global map. An important feature I have presented in my report is the influence of PayPal service in India and how it can benefit our economy and avert corruption and black money. 
</p>

<p>
	With this trending feature of the web, PayPal surely has a bright future. It has already managed to cover almost all the aspects of an actual bank and has fared consistently well to its 100 million users. A growing business for marketers and consumers with an unmatched security layer of data protection, PayPal has remained the one stop solution to safe online payments and customer satisfaction for many years now. It is with certainty that I believe PayPal as the only advanced web transaction service to function with a 100% guarantee to safeguard customer information and deliver a fresh user experience to each and every Individual who buys or sells.
