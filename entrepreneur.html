                    <p>Gone are the days, when individuals used to work so hard to reach the high levels of competition and expectations imposed by their parents and peers. The world and its components are exclusively meant to be developed. It’s a never-ending process and this unmatched speed of evolution manages to keep everyone on their toes. One must understand the value of this speed and must appropriately inculcate the habit of proper existence in which ‘survival’ is a key prospect.</p>

                    <p>What does one have to do to survive such conditions? Does he wait till everything comes into place one day? Does he think about all the negative aspects of dealing with such situations? In short, does he follow his dreams and become what he wants to be.</p>

                    <p>We often come across people who have a clear ambition, an idea yet to be ignited or a creative thought process that with some effort and proper planning can come alive. Unfortunately though, we live in a society where disbelief and fear is dominant. </p>

                    <p>The following article will be all about how to survive the world of ventures and will guide you into how to stay satisfied and happy in the central zone of Entrepreneurship. </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">How to START?</h2>

                    <p>This part outlines the basis of beginning your venture and will give you all a clear view of the workings of small businesses. I will try and keep it short and precise so that you get a clear understanding of everything.</p>

                    <p>
                    	<ol>
                        	<li>If you are in the lookout for a business that would cater to only a few individuals, then a small survey conducted in the particular field would initialise the range of your venture. Start your survey with a small group of volunteers and build a scenario where you could analyse situations and possibilities. Be sure to include people other than your friends so that you get realistic values. Once you are done with the survey you will be able to determine the entire Do’s and Don’ts of your assignment.
                            </li>
                            <li>Now you have a road map that will help you see where you are being lead to. You just have to design a navigator that will guide you in your turns. Take the collected values from your survey and design a scheme that will bring about the workings of your plan i.e. How to Execute? 
                            </li>
                         </ol>
                     </p>

                   <h2 class="section-heading">How to DO IT?</h2>

                    <p>Remember that you are not alone. There are a lot many people who are growing and falling in their respective fields. Most of all this happens in situations where proper implementation does not take place. After the planning phase and getting a clear understanding of what has to be done, you are halfway through. All you have to do now is to build a working environment where proper functioning of your plans take place.</p>

                    <p>
                    	<ol>
                        	<li>Start with the basic necessities such as human resource, raw materials and a business map that will give you perspectives of different processes of work. Ensure that you include the right kind of people to work with you. Prefer those who have qualities of passion and hard work. Those who have a habit of being inconsistent and fragile are bad for the company. Take proper tests and hire those who chose to learn things rather than fall for the money you will be offering them. Be sure to include people who can market your venture well. This is extremely important if your audience exists on the web (am sure it does).
                            </li>
                            <li>Once you are sure about the people who are going to work with you, start assigning specific jobs to each one of them. This may sound obvious, but by specific I mean not all, but enough for them to begin realizing their goal. Do not try and overload them as it would result in incompletion and ambiguities. Bind them to a particular aspect of your company and make them feel important. Maintain this culture as keeping good internal relations is always advantageous.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                            As I said before, you are not alone. The moment you begin your company, you will be subjected to equal levels of appreciation and criticism. Be brave enough to be challenged with all kinds of emotions as they can ‘make’ as well as ‘break’ your goal. The best way to fight it out (and trust me it works) is to simply acknowledge the appreciation and discard the criticism. Remember, you are the leader of your pack and your actions will be taken into account by all your colleagues and staff members. So, be the mastermind not the pioneer.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                            Executing your plan should not be tough if you have the right kind of expertise. Knowledge about your plan, work and market should always be imbibed into all your workers. Trust them, and welcome their ideas and admire their viewpoint (once a while, take it into consideration too). 
                            </li>
                            </ol>
                            </p>

                    <p>
The above points might not answer many questions but are a sure shot requirement for most companies (like mine). Since my objective is not to bore you with the technical know-hows of a company, I may have missed out on some issues that are equally necessary.
</p>

                    <p>Wait! What? That’s it? Will that be just enough for me to go on and a start a new business? The answer without doubt is a ‘NO’. To be flagged off as a starter, well yes, you are. But, remember that you need to understand the proximity of being an entrepreneur with risk. You should be thorough with your understandings of what you will do with your business and take appropriate risks at regular intervals to reach the sky. By this time, I am sure that most of you have understood the basic guidelines of starting a company. Prepare yourself well before you start off because there are people out there waiting to rub shoulders.</p>
                    
                    <p>
                    Entrepreneurship is all about courage. All the best!!!<br>
